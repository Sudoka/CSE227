\section{Introduction}
As services are often developped around virtualization, vulnerabilities in hypervisors can now
have critical impact on businesses.

\subsection{Impact of hypervisor vulnerabilites}
There are many ways to acces a virtual machine, through other vulnerabilities of
the softwares which are running inside of the virtual machine or through
usage of a public service (e.g. VPS provided by \emph{Rackspace} or instances
provided by \emph{Amazon EC2}).
In our study, we assume that the attacker has access to a virtual machine
running on top of a shared host.

If an attacker is able to find a vulnerabilitie in the hypervisor, it may have
terrible consequence on the other virtual machines :
\begin{description}
\item[Denial of Service] If the attacker is able to crash the hypervisor or part
of it, he could impact all the virtual machine running on top of it.
\item[Data leak] If an attacker is able to read arbitrary location in the memory
or hard drive of the hypervisor, he could steal business critical information.
Even through an attacker can't find a way to execute code he can still have
access of some resources like the hard drive and the attacker can steal
other users information or sensitive data.
\item[Control flow hijacking] This case would be the worst one. If the attacker
is able to execute arbitrary code in the host, he would have access of all
resources in the host, including the ressources of the other virtual machines.
This would allow him to access data, crash the other virtual machines but also
execute more subtle attacks.
\end{description}

These type of attacks are widely documented in the litterature, the main point is
that vulnerabilities at the hypervisor level may impact the host but also the other
virtual machines running on the hypervisor.

\subsection{Aim}
We think that we may answer the following questions :
\begin{itemize}
\item Are there similarities in the vulnerabilites which were already disclosed ?
\item Are the recent discolsed vulnerabilities exploitable to gain access to host
ressources from the guest ?
\item Can we easily find new vulnerabilities ?
\item How can we detect or prevent them ?
\end{itemize}
