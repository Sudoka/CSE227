\paragraph{Abstract}
With the emergence of cloud computing and server consolidation at large scale,
virtualization has reached an important status in the business development and IT management
of almost all companies.
Usually virtualization is considered as a way to isolate application, for
performance and for security reason.
Vulnerabilities in hypervisors can now have a critical impact and defeat
the assumption that virtualization is a protection.
An application vulnerabilitie coupled to an hypervisor vulnerabilitie could
possibly allow an attacker to take control of hundreds of virtual machine.

Some work attempt to reduce the Trusted Computing Base to improve security.
Other design of virtual machine monitor (VMM) allow the user to benefit of the
existing security functionnalities of the operating system in addition to the
VMM isolation.
The major improvement in isolation are achieved by the new functionalities
offered by the hardware manufacturers through hardware-assisted virtualization.
